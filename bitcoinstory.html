21 Days of Bitcoin | Learn Bitcoin | Earn Bitcoin 

Magic. Internet. Money
Otherwise known as Bitcoin.

Welcome to 21 Days of Bitcoin. Over the next three weeks, you'll
gain a deeper understanding of what exactly this mysterious,
revolutionary new technology is. By the end of this course, you'll
finally figure out what millions of people around the world are 
already realizing: Bitcoin is hope.



A Brief History 

On January3, 2009, a pseudonymous genius named Satoshi
Nakamoto officially invented Bitcoin.

Whoever this mystery person or group is, they managed to create 
the world's first cryptocurrency that would soon change everything
as we know it. Formally defined, bitcoin (capital "B") is a global,
borderless, decentralized protocol that enables the peer-to-peer
exchanges of the bitcoin currency (lowercase "b"), Which has a fixed
max supply and a known, decereasing issuance rate.

it allows us to send money to anyone, anywhere in the world, without
the need for an intermediary.

Bitcoin doesn't aim to anything innovative-rather, it offers an
improved alternatives to the existing inequitable, inaccessible, and
inflationary finencial system. By decentralizing finance, we are 
progressively simplifying a system so complex that it locks out 
nearly two billion people worldwide, and turning it into a permission-
less network that anyone can be a part of.


                 BITCOIN: A PEER-TO-PEER
                 ELECTRONIC CASH SYSTEM       By: SATOSHI NAKAMOTO
        
        A purely peer-to-peer version of 
        electronic cash would allow online
        payments to be sent directly from 
        one party to another without going 
        through a financial institution.

What does Bitcoion save?

Centralization: Bitcoin alleviates the need for a centralized third-
party system - lilke a credit card company or a central bank - to
confirm and validate transactions. Rather than requiring the current
base-layer financial system to broke our transfer and settlements,
Bitcoin works purely peer-to-peer, ridding the need for trust in a
centralized government controller.

Verifiability: Bitcoin enables unit-level currency validation that isn't 
possible with fiat (government-backed money). For instance,there 
are plenty of fake dollor bills in circulation (the U.S Tresury
estimates that one in every 10,000 bills is counterfeit)that the 
average person fails to discover. However,nobody can create fake
bitcoin because the Bitcoion network is secured cryptographically via 
a public blockchain that anybody can access and validate any 
amount of bitcoin as real.

Inflation: Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million. There will never be 
any more bitcoin than that. No one can just "print more bitcoin” like
we currently print dollars, inflating the money supply. Unlike fiat 
curriencies, bitcoin dosen't take away your purchasing power Over
time.

"I don't understand anything you just said"

Don't worry, if concepts like "blockchain" and "decentralzation" might
sound confusing right now, but i'll be explaining in detail
over the next 21 days. The  truth is, we don't need to dive too deeply
into exactly how the techinical aspects if Bitcoin function. However,
you're right to be skeptical if i just tell you to trust that it works. After
all, bitcoin is all about getting rid of the need for trust.

"But... how can it be that i don't need to trust anyone? How do i know
that Bitcoin isn't a scam? Will bitcoin make me rich? What is bitcoin's 
intrensic value? There must be someone msnaging Bitcoin, right?"

These are all valid questions that will soon be answered in a way
that, hopefully, anyone can understand. For this introductory lecture,
we'll briefly cover the skelton of how bitcoin operates. Over the next
three weeks, you'll learn everything from how to make your first 
bitcoin transactions to how bitcoin is already bringing global financial
freedom to millions around thre world.



The Bitcoin Blockchain 
Ah, yes The mystical, almighty blockchain that is supposedly
revolutionising the teach industry right now. While it may seem 
daunting to dry and understand what a blockchain is and how it
operates, you basically already know what it is- the name gives it
away.







Yes, it is literally a chain of (digital) blocks that holds data as a 
publlicly visible ledger. It’s history and validity are verified by Bitcoin.
full nodes across the global that each keep a full copy of the 
blockchain history.

Beacause transaction are secured by the public blockchain, there is
no need for an intermediary source of trust in order to confirm that
your coins are real or that your transaction aren't fraudulent; the
publically verifiable, mathematically programmed, cryptographically
sound Bitcoin blockchain is the only proof you need.

Bitcoin is sound Money

It's no secret that the current financial system is deeply broken, With
rampant hyperinflation, global economic inequity, and dependence
on the nation-states that hold global power, fiat isn't truly backed by 
anything sound-it's a product of power and control.

if we want to escape the control of the powers that be, we'll need an
alternative system. Bitcoin is currency with no central authority. No
government can control it ,so it's not going to suffer from endless
round of quantitative easing or any other money printing schemes
government employ.

Might this be the money solution we've been looking for?

Congratulations on taking your first leap down the Bitcoin rabbit
hole. By  the end of these 21 days, you'll have abasic understanding
of how bitcoin works, what Bitcoin represents, andf how Bitcoin will
fix the world. Remember to attentively read each lession that arrives
in your inbox; after all this is a course with a quiz at the end, and
you'll need at least a B-(17/21) to pass this class for a chance to 
win 1,000,000 satoshis (what's a "satoshi"? Pay attention to find out!).

Tomorrow, I’ll go over who is secretly in charge of Bitcoin (just
Kidding nobody is).
